## How to backup UWP Apps ?

To backup UWP App I recommend to use amazing tool created by Wapitiii which you can find here:

*Hint
If Backup doesn't seem to contain all data which you want to backup, look for files inside %LocalAppData%\Packages\
You can also use ProcessMonitor app to find which files your current UWP App uses: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/
